Features that are being met:

Interact with a database to store and retrieve information (note the store in a database was completed it was uploaded to the firebase database as well as local storage, the retrieve information and utilize information is a stretch goal that I will complete as I can.

In this capstone project I'm doing 4 pages.

Page 1, will contain an index.html page that has a navigation bar at the top, which will allow you to come back to the home 
page or the navigation page.   It will allow you go the meme generator page, the mock sign-up page, and the motivational quote and image 
page.  There is also a script.js file and a styles.css file which will contain the styles to all of the a pages.

Page 2, will  contain a fitness-meme.html file which will allow you to take a file from your computer.   Write a caption over 
the photo and a caption under the photo.   It will allow you to generate the meme.  It will allow you to download the meme so that you 
can use it for yourself or share it with others to help motivate them. It will be styled by the styles.css file and it will contain its own javascript 
file meme.js.

Page 3, will contain a signup.html file which will allow you to fill a form out like you are signing up for your local fitness club.   The form will be able 
to be saved in local storage so that you can use that data when you need.  It will also be saved to the fireside data base app which will give you another
avenue to utlize this set of data.  It will be styled by the styles.css file and it will contain it's own javascript file signup.js.

Page 4, will contain a motivate.html file will will allow to click on the box and it will display a random inspiration quote from https://api.adviceslip.com/advice and 
it will contain a motivational image from the unsplash api.  It will be styled with the styles.css file and it will contain it's own javascript file quotes.js.
